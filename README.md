# Playlist_Organizer 
Made to organize songs into playlists for an easier way to keep track of playlists you've wanted to make.  
You can use buttons on the pages for easier navigation.

## Add songs to different playlists 
Add a song to any of the playlists by giving the title, author, and genre of the song.  
There are limited and a select few playlists you can chose from, some emotion and others activity playlist options.
There are also limited genres, so pick whichever is closest in style to your chosen song if it can't be found.

## View current songs in playlists 
View all the songs you've added in each of the respective playlists.
Delete individual songs from a playlist or delete the songs from the entire playlist itself with a single button.
